# openbox-themes
A couple of configuration for different openbox setups mostly for personal use

#Matrix-like

This theme consist of different customizations of Openbox theme and some applications I use.
You can apply this configuration to each application independently.

Not all of theme are my personal work, I'll make sure to put a reference to the original creator for every customization.

Make sure to do a backup of the previous styles

### Xchat [0]
The two files colors.conf and pevents.conf must go in ~/.xchat2/
If you can't see certain characters use pevents.conf in B-Version.

#### Guake
# With a couple of useful key bindings
Place the whole directory content into ~/.gconf/apps/guake

### Conky
Place .conkyrc in ~/.conkyrc

### Icons[1]
Place the folder in /usr/share/icons

### OB Theme
Upload it just as you would do with any .obt
