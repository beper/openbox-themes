#Matrix-like

This theme consist of different customizations of Openbox theme and some applications I use.
You can apply this configuration to each application independently.
I also add an autoinstaller for most paths so you don't have to do everything manually.
Just open "install.sh" and on thefirst line add your username at USR="user"

Not all of theme are my personal work, I'll make sure to put a reference to the original creator for every customization.

Make sure to do a backup of the previous styles. The install.sh script will do it for you in case with the extension .old or creating a "backup" folder.
